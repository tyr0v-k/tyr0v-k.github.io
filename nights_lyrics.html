        <p>1. Endless Hallucinations<br>
          <p>The world is hollow and I have touched the sky<br>
          This empty shell will not contain my mind<br>
          Gazing out at the stars I see worlds down below<br>
          Within my past I want to take control
          <p>I have no mouth<br>
          And I must scream
          <p>Flying past the stars<br>
          Black wings take me far<br>
          I live in endless hallucinations<br>
          Drifting into the night<br>
          To find a better life<br>
          I live in endless hallucinations
          <p>The sun that gives us life travels through space and time<br>
          I did not want what's on the other side<br>
          My fellow travelers go with me in the night<br>
          Shall be stripped from me, I hope they all die
          <p>I have no mouth<br>
          And I must scream
          <p>Flying past the stars<br>
          Black wings take me far<br>
          I live in endless hallucinations<br>
          Drifting into the night<br>
          To find a better life<br>
          I live in endless hallucinations
          <p>2. Rainbow Nights
            <p>Wandering to a higher plane<br>
          In search of fortune is my game<br>
          Blade for blood is the law<br>
          A lonely journey done before
          <p>The sun, surging dawn
            <p>Rise up and reach for the sky<br>
          Journey to rainbow nights<br>
          You'll never take me away<br>
          In rainbow nights I will stay
          <p>A lonesome scarecrow on his own<br>
          Feared by all on the broken throne<br>
          In search of sleep far and wide<br>
          I hang my hat and drift to night<br>
          <p>The sun, surging dawn
            <p>Rise up and reach for the sky<br>
          Journey to rainbow nights<br>
          You'll never take me away<br>
          In rainbow nights I will stay
          <p>Rise up and reach for the sky<br>
          Journey to rainbow nights<br>
          You'll never take me away<br>
          In rainbow nights I will stay
          <p>3. Get Out
            <p>Left in darkness once again<br>
          My mind begins to race on times lost back when<br>
          This pitted torment seems to only belong to me<br>
          And is all I know and all I can see
          <p>As something comes to me<br>
          It's calling me in the night<br>
          (THE NIGHT)<br>
          And it's plain to see, takes hold of me<br>
          Through delight the world is burning bright
          <p>You've gotta get out<br>
          There's a fire within my heart that's gotta get out<br>
          And it's been there from the start, you've gotta get out<br>
          There's a fire within my heart that's gotta get out<br>
          And it's tearing me apart
          <p>The weight above me never sleeps<br>
          These chains just pull me down and drag me to my feet<br>
          I stand here naked vulnerable and weak<br>
          And it's all I've known and I want to break free
          <p>As something comes to me<br>
          It's calling me in the night<br>
          (THE NIGHT)<br>
          And it's plain to see, takes hold of me<br>
          You delight the world is burning bright
          <p>You've gotta get out<br>
          There's a fire within my heart that's gotta get out<br>
          And it's been there from the start, you've gotta get out<br>
          There's a fire within my heart that's gotta get out<br>
          And it's tearing me apart
          <p>Tell me the future, where will I go?<br>
          I wanna know, just wanna know<br>
          Riding through the kingdom on a chariot of gold<br>
          My life takes hold, I'll never let go
          <p>You've gotta get out<br>
          There's a fire within my heart that's gotta get out<br>
          And it's been there from the start, you've gotta get out<br>
          There's a fire within my heart that's gotta get out<br>
          And it's tearing me apart
          <p>4. Kali
            <p>Kick it
              <p>These tired eyes hear your cries<br>
          Beckon me in times of war<br>
          Old and frail I cannot fail<br>
          Enlighten me to conquer all
          <p>Please ancient mind, the last of divine<br>
          Prepare for the fight, the power is mine
          <p>Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          Mother of Death I call on thee<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          I give my soul eternally<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          Mother of Death I call on thee<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          Spill of the blood of my enemies tonight
          <p>Standing tall, my last call<br>
          Sword in hand is shining bright<br>
          Into the fray is where I stay<br>
          Blinding rage until my dying day
          <p>Please ancient mind, the last of divine<br>
          Prepare for the fight, the power is mine
          <p>Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          Mother of Death I call on thee<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          I give my soul eternally<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          Mother of Death I call on thee<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          Spill of the blood of my enemies tonight<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          Mother of Death I call on thee<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          I give my soul eternally<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          Mother of Death I call on thee<br>
          Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
          Spill of the blood of my enemies tonight
          <p>5. Mothers Lullaby
            <p>But I am programmed<br>
          You wouldn't care<br>
          A face of love down lay here (?)<br>
          You'd got to teach me what I know<br>
          You give me strength now as I grow
          <p>Become a man [become a man]<br>
          I know who you are [i know who you are]<br>
          My son, my light [my son, my light]<br>
          My burning star [my burning star]
          <p>You brought me to this world alone<br>
          You keep me safe from the unknown<br>
          Lay your head and don't you cry<br>
          And hear your mothers lullaby
          <p>Mother I’m guilty<br>
          I must say<br>
          I'm home and now I'm on my way<br>
          Mother I thank you<br>
          What you’ve done<br>
          Domo Arigato Roboto-San
          <p>Become a man [become a man]<br>
          I know who you are [i know who you are]<br>
          My son, my light [my son, my light]<br>
          My burning star [my burning star]
          <p>You brought me to this world alone<br>
          You keep me safe from the unknown<br>
          Lay your head and don't you cry<br>
          And hear your mothers lullaby
          <p>You brought me to this world alone<br>
          You keep me safe from the unknown<br>
          Lay your head and don't you cry<br>
          And hear your mothers lullaby<br>
          You brought me to this world alone<br>
          You keep me safe from the unknown<br>
          Lay your head and don't you cry<br>
          And hear your mothers lullaby
          <p>[good night my son, good night]
            <p>6. The Truth
              <p>There is no beauty in the truth<br>
          The lies you lead take hold of you<br>
          Deep in your conscious you will find<br>
          Who you truly are deep inside
          <p>You want it, you need it, you got to have the truth<br>
          You want it, you need it, it's taken over you<br>
          You want it, you need it, you'll never find the truth<br>
          You want it, you need it, I'll keep it all from you
          <p>You twist our words to suit your lies<br>
          Changing reality will leave you blind<br>
          Deep in your psyche is where we live<br>
          Paranoid delusions now begin
          <p>You want it, you need it, you got to have the truth<br>
          You want it, you need it, it's taken over you<br>
          You want it, you need it, you'll never find the truth<br>
          You want it, you need it, I'll keep it all from you
          <p>You want it, you need it, you got to have the truth<br>
          You want it, you need it, it's taken over you<br>
          You want it, you need it, you'll never find the truth<br>
          You want it, you need it, I'll keep it all from you<br>
