        <p>1. Burning Bridges
          <p>The time has come where all will be undone<br>
          A legacy imitated by the sheep
          <p>[?]
          <p>We light the fire for our own funeral pyre<br>
          Tasteless desires, not names to be<br>
          As time goes on our flame will carry on<br>
          Burning bridges in our way<br>
          And it seems like<br>
          As time goes on our flame will carry on<br>
          Burning bridges in our way
          <p>It's time to burn
          <p>Future with no sun, only darkness overcomes<br>
          This magick sea lays dormant to me<br>
          Only the head is, the body is weak, cutting the legs from underneath [?]
          <p>We light the fire for our own funeral pyre<br>
          Tasteless desires, not names to be<br>
          As time goes on our flame will carry on<br>
          Burning bridges in our way<br>
          And it seems like<br>
          As time goes on our flame will carry on<br>
          Burning bridges in our way
          <p>It's time to burn
            <p>We light the fire for our own funeral pyre<br>
          Tasteless desires, not names to be<br>
          As time goes on our flame will carry on<br>
          Burning bridges in our way<br>
          And it seems like<br>
          As time goes on our flame will carry on<br>
          Burning bridges in our way
          <p>It's time to burn
            <p>2. Breaking Free
              <p>I'm leaving this planet behind<br>
          Heading out into the great unknown<br>
          I'm strapped to my rocket ship<br>
          I'm ready, ready to go<br>
          I travel through time and space<br>
          Gonna leave everything behind<br>
          I'm traveling to an unknown place<br>
          To break free from the chains that bind
          <p>I'm seeing stars, I'm seeing galaxies<br>
          I'm reaching for the end of the universe<br>
          I'm breaking through the atmosphere<br>
          I'm leaving earth behind<br>
          I am breaking free
          <p>Flying through the endless void<br>
          We're on a mission to explore<br>
          Space travel is our joy<br>
          We'll never be ignored
          <p>I travel through time and space<br>
          Gonna leave everything behind<br>
          I'm traveling to an unknown place<br>
          To break free from the chains that bind
          <p>I'm seeing stars, I'm seeing galaxies<br>
          I'm reaching for the end of the universe<br>
          I'm breaking through the atmosphere<br>
          I'm leaving earth behind<br>
          I am breaking free<br>

          <p>3. Dinosaurs
            <p>My life will never change<br>
          These days are very strange<br>
          Where do we go from here<br>
          I shed a single tear
          <p>My baby cries, she has her father's eyes<br>
          My wife always nagging me<br>
          I have no doubt<br>
          I hit the streets for company
          <p>Left at home<br>
          Wife and child alone<br>
          I don't care, I will go on my own
          <p>Dinosaurs are my best friends<br>
          Through thick and thin, until the very end<br>
          People tell me, do not pretend<br>
          Stop living in your made up world again<br>
          But the dinosaurs, they're real to me<br>
          They bring me up and make me happy<br>
          I just know the world can see<br>
          The dinosaurs are a part of me
          <p>At night I feel no pain, I'll never be the same<br>
          My wife, she calls to me<br>
          Return to us, we need to see<br>
          But my love has gone, I want to be alone<br>
          And exist in another place<br>
          Where dinos play is where I will stay
          <p>Left at home<br>
          Wife and child alone<br>
          I don't care, I will go on my own
          <p>Dinosaurs are my best friends<br>
          Through thick and thin, until the very end<br>
          People tell me, do not pretend<br>
          Stop living in your made up world again<br>
          But the dinosaurs, they're real to me<br>
          They bring me up and make me happy<br>
          Hold on now, I think I see<br>
          A dinosaur wants to play with me
          <p>Dinosaurs are my best friends<br>
          Through thick and thin, until the very end<br>
          People tell me, do not pretend<br>
          Stop living in your made up world again<br>
          But the dinosaurs, they're real to me<br>
          They bring me up and make me happy<br>
          Oh my god, it dawns on me<br>
          The dinosaurs will be the death of me
          <p>4. Let Go
            <p>Love<br>
          Why does it always end in pain<br>
          When you left and walked out that door<br>
          Things for us will never be the same<br>
          (Just get it)<br>
          I've said one thousand times<br>
          I love you forever-more<br>
          But I lay at home<br>
          On my own<br>
          I know that love is gone
          <p>I feel the darkness as Its creeping in<br>
          and slowly begins to win<br>
          'Cause it's plain to see<br>
          We were meant to be<br>
          and I just...
          <p>LET GO<br>
          of this pain you gave me<br>
          I opened my heart<br>
          but now I just fall apart<br>
          as I LET GO<br>
          of this pain you gave me<br>
          The dark pulls us in and enters my world
          <p>Death<br>
          So glad to see you here so soon<br>
          I look back at how we lived our lives<br>
          and wonder when the flowers stopped to bloom<br>
          But now that time moved on<br>
          and I'm left wanting more<br>
          That it cannot be<br>
          and I wish to see<br>
          that a death is at the door
          <p>I thought our love was strong,<br>
          but now it's all gone<br>
          I can't believe it's over<br>
          I thought we'd last forever
          <p>I gave you all my love<br>
          but it wasn't enough<br>
          You tore my heart in two<br>
          and I don't know what to do
          <p>So now you hear these words<br>
          Of how things seem to be<br>
          I wish that I could enjoy life<br>
          but that remains to see
          <p>I wish you the whole world,<br>
          with happiness that I could not bring<br>
          I shall return to my empty den<br>
          and dream of better days
          <p>5. Mystery
            <p>I’m a cosmic investigator<br>

          I’ve been chasing down some clues<br>

          <p>I’ve been searching for the truth<br>

          Are they hidden in plain sight?
